# Identifying `Filler Material`

After meeting briefly with Senay, I met with Jon to discuss what our approach to identifying issue "filler-material" should be.  There was consensus that it should be a _process of elimination_, starting with a `.md` file containing all of the issue's content, and removing elements that are clearly part of an individual article.  We also agreed that the issue's *Table of Contents* (TOC) should be used to guide this identification and elimination process.

## Example: _Volume III Issue 2_ (Spring 2017)

The following screen capture image shows the issue's _Table of Contents_ with annotations to indicate what should be identified as "filler material".

In the above image there are 6 elements identified for inclusion as "filler material".  They are circled in <span style=color:red;>red</span> in the TOC image.  Note that each has a distinct entry in the TOC.

One similar TOC entry, _"Untitled photograph" by Sandy Moffet_ from page 14 should NOT be included as filler material since it relates directly to the _"Dead Gun (short story)" by Sandy Moffet_.  It appears as a separate entry in the TOC only because of the _"Untitled photograph" by Ken Saunders II_ which appears on page 11.  When that Ken Saunders II image is "removed" from the Moffett article the image from page 14 is naturally "reunited" with the article.  The natural inclusion of the page 14 image with the article is noted by a <span style=color:yellow;>yellow</span> arrow annotation in the image above.

Also note that the recipe which appears on page 72 should not be identified as filler material since it has no separate entry in the TOC; it naturally belongs with the _Mushrooms in the Midwest_ article that spans pages 67 to 72.  This natural inclusion in the article is noted by a <span style=color:lightgreen;>green</span> circle in the image above.
