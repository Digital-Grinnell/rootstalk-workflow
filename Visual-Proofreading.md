# Visual Proofreading

This document is intended to guide the process of visually proofreading _Rootstalk_ in a `Mac` environment. `Windows` users are encouraged to discover, and document, a similar approach.

## Workflow Summary

The guidance provided here essentially calls for the following steps:

  - Identify a single _Rootstalk_ issue to be proofread  
  - Open the selected issue's `development` copy at https://icy-tree-020380010.azurestaticapps.net  
    - For example, I choose `Volume VII Issue 2` (Spring 2021) so I opened https://icy-tree-020380010.azurestaticapps.net/volume-vii-issue-2/.  
  - Scan the issue page and each article in the issue looking for things like:  
    - Missing images  
    - Obvious spelling errors  
    - Poor layout  
  - Capture and annotate a screen image of any errors  
  - Appropriately name the captured image and store in a provided OneDrive folder  
  - Repeat for each article in the issue  

## Workflow Details

Here are the detailed steps in the visual proofreading workflow.  Remember, this document assumes you are working with a `Mac`, not a cell phone, tablet, or `Windows` computer.  If you attempt this process on any other device please adjust accordingly and document your work for future proofreaders.

### 1 - Choose an Issue and Open the DEV Instance of the Website

Open a web browser of your choice (I use _Firefox_) and navigate to our current DEV instance of _Rootstalk_ at https://icy-tree-020380010.azurestaticapps.net.  Select your issue from that page or from the [Past Issues page](https://icy-tree-020380010.azurestaticapps.net/past-issues/).

### 2 - Visually Scan the Page for Problems

Scan the page looking for obvious problems like:  
  - Missing images  
  - Obvious spelling errors  
  - Poor layout  

If you spot any problems on the page refer to the section titled [Reporting A Problem](#reporting-a-problem) below.

### 3 - Repeat For Each Article in the Issue

Open each article in the issue, visually scan it for problems, and use the guidance in [Reporting A Problem](#reporting-a-problem) to record your findings.

## Reporting A Problem

If you find any problem(s) on a page please follow the steps outlined in the appropriate video with links provided below.  Note that there's one video for Mac/OSX users and another specifically for Windows users.
