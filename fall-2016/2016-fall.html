We think of prairie as the ecosystem that dominated North America&apos;s central portion, roughly from Illinois to the Rocky Mountains and from southern Canada to Texas. It comprised thousands of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms in soil, water, and air, all shimmering in a web of life. But note the use of the past tense. Much has changed in the prairie region. </span></p>

An overwhelming human presence has risen, bringing with it industrial agriculture on a scale unprecedented anywhere. In 1850, tallgrass prairie covered 80 percent of Iowa; today, less than one-tenth of one percent of the original Iowa prairie remains</span><span class="CharOverride-4">—</span><span class="CharOverride-12">surely one of the most rapid and complete destructions of an ecosystem in human history. So: what does it mean to say </span><span class="CharOverride-13">Rootstalk</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> is a prairie journal? </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">H</span><span class="CharOverride-12">ere’s our answer: we resolutely believe prairie remains a living presence in the actions and thinking of those who live here. Prairie ecosystem processes took thousands of years to make the Midwest&apos;s soils among the most productive in the world. Farming is paradoxically both the main beneficiary of the prairie ecosystem and the primary cause of its demise. Midwestern agriculture is a direct consequence of the prairie ecosystem.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-12">nother prairie legacy is the region&apos;s characteristic settlement pattern: a blanketing of family-run farms, a scattering of small and mid-sized towns, and a few larger cities. This is how agricultural production and the population supporting it were organized, and it reflects also how that production was marketed. In recent decades we&apos;ve seen the pattern shifting: farms are fewer and larger, and many small towns are shriveling while cities grow. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">F</span><span class="CharOverride-12">or 150 years, agriculture</span><span class="CharOverride-4">—</span><span class="CharOverride-12">hence the prairie</span><span class="CharOverride-4">—</span><span class="CharOverride-12">has shaped the region&apos;s human presence. From the planned removal of the Indians and the influx of white settlers, to the later arrival of African-Americans to work in the coal mines and factories, the region&apos;s myriad peoples and stories have all been impacted by the prairie. As agriculture began its mid-twentieth century pivot toward industrial methods of production, people left farms for cities. Latinos entered the region to accept difficult jobs in the meat-packing industry, and many with advanced educations departed for the coasts. Artists, writers, and musicians documented and commented on the changes in the region, and</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> </span><span class="CharOverride-12"> through time religious leaders sought to address the spiritual needs of those experiencing all of these changes.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-12">o us at </span><span class="CharOverride-13">Rootstalk</span><span class="CharOverride-12">, then, the prairie is an ecosystem, but much more. The prairie is a geographical region host to generations of rich and sometimes difficult history. It is a suite of memories and ideas about wholeness, diversity, loss, conflict, community, and change. Today, many in the region are working to protect and restore prairie. Perhaps this is a harbinger of and model for a broader renewal in a challenged region.</span></p>

			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-2">M</span>ason City is a mid-sized Midwest rural community in North Central Iowa. Its population in the 2010 census was 28,052. Although our town has grown into a significant retail center for North Iowa, and there has been great buzz around the world in regards to our architectural and cultural history, <a href="http://www.masoncity.net/"><span class="Hyperlink">Mason City</span></a> has fallen on hard times. From the early 1900’s to about 1980, it was a growing city with great industry and retail. After the farm crisis of the 1980s and with its aging demographic, it has been slowly declining in population. Many industries left or closed during the recession of 2007-08. In the late 1970’s, our graduating classes had been between 500-600; they have since fallen to just under 300. </p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> </span>am an American History and American Government teacher with over 20 years of experience. As with many American History teachers, I have taught theory of politics, economics, and interpretation of history. But when I was elected to Mason City’s city council in 2011, my decisions and thoughts were no longer located merely in the world of theory. My decisions were going to have consequences, for better or for worse. I ran on three basic pledges: I would help to build for Mason City’s future while maintaining its rich cultural past; I would continue to work toward the enhancement of amenities for individuals and families, and I would listen to all citizens, helping to create an environment of compromise and open dialogue. In the spring of 2016, these pledges seemed to collide. An economic deal between <a href="http://www.prestagefarms.com/"><span class="Hyperlink">Prestage Farms</span></a>, a North Carolina-based large-scale turkey and pork producer, and Mason City would be proposed and debated until the final city council vote May 2nd, 2016.</p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I </span><span class="CharOverride-4">received a call in late February 2016 from our local Economic Development Coordinator, Chad Schrenck. He wanted to fill me in on a possible development which would be the largest tax revenue source for the city, four times larger than that produced by the next closest industry. At the meeting, I learned the company in question was going to be a pork processor, the Mason City plant was going to have a $100 million guaranteed valuation, and it planned to hire up to 2,000 employees. It seemed like the kind of home run economic developers look for, the kind which could be a game-changer for Mason City. We did talk a little about the cultural impact a plant of this size would have on our community. These 2,000 new workers would come primarily from Bosnia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central America, and Southeastern Asia—demographic groups generally not well represented in the rural Midwest. I immediately realized that there would be a push-back, but grossly underestimated the magnitude and severity of the opposition. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">O</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ver the next couple of weeks, I started researching meat packing companies both small and large. One book I came across was </span><a href="http://scholarworks.uni.edu/facbook/186/"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-5">Postville U.S.A; Surviving Diversity in Small-Town America</span></a><span class="CharOverride-4">, written by University of Northern Iowa professors Mark Grey and Michelle Devlin and former Postville City Councilman Aaron Goldsmith. This book became the basis for all my research and questions. The book details the lead-up to the May 12, 2008 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid on the Agriprocessors kosher meatpacking plant in Postville, and the ensuing fallout. At the time, the authors say,  this was “the largest raid of a single-site employer in United States history, strip[ping] the meat plant of most of its workforce, and cut[ting] Postville’s population by more than 20 percent.” The authors don’t lay guilt for this disaster at the feet of any one person or group, but rather discuss how many influences and entities came together in the event: Orthodox Jews, Hispanics, the American Midwest, ICE, the U.S. judicial system, and corporate interests. By the end of the book, Professors Grey and Devlin and Mr. Goldsmith had many suggestions concerning how the two parties—the corporations and the local communities—might have worked together for their mutual benefit. To me, the most important conclusion was simple: any company like Agriprocessors must realize its role in making such a venture a success, and it must be willing to meet the needs of the community in which it is located. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I </span><span class="CharOverride-4">ended up meeting with Professor Grey in person and having several phone conversations with him. When the City Administrator and I met him in Cedar Falls in late March, he gave us some questions to ask representatives of Prestage (by now, the name of the company had been made public). Most of the questions concerned hiring practices, where the workers would be coming from, and whether there was a plan of for helping workers assimilate into the local area. Nowhere in the discussion did we talk about environmental concerns, or the impact that slaughtering 10,000 hogs a day would have on the local environment.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">O</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ur first meeting in the process of coming to a development agreement was very significant. At this meeting, my fellow councilman Alex Kuhn and I were very optimistic, but we both made comments and expressed concerns. Councilman Kuhn’s comments centered more on the workers’ pay and how much we would rebate tax revenue to Prestage; mine concerned the funding gap to the schools. Since the money we received from property taxes always lags behind expenses by a year, the schools would have to come up with the money up front. Plus, the property taxes would not be enough to allow us to recoup the money lost the previous year. By my calculation, there would be a five-year funding gap before the revenues caught up to the debt. My concern was simple: the year the company opened with a potential for 351 new households and 700 new students </span>in our local <span class="CharOverride-4">school system (David Swenson, ISU), the cost to the school would be immediate. However, property taxes are all paid a year later, meaning that the tax revenue we would depend on to help defray these expenses would lag 12 months behind. Even assuming the students came in speaking English and didn’t require any extra services or support, just the sheer number of students would require the schools to hire new staff and incur additional expenses. That would mean, under the most optimistic projections, the schools would potentially have to come up with a million or so dollars to prepare for this new influx of students, regardless of the students’ language background. If the new students came in needing support from ESL (English as a Second Language) and teachers needed more training to educate, as well as the support of more paraprofessionals, it would create a catastrophic demand in a system already on a stretched budget. The revenue the schools received simply could not cover those costs. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">s I was waiting for specific numbers regarding the funding, over the next couple of weeks things started getting really loud. I would estimate that over a three-week period I received over 1,000 emails concerning the proposed plant, with probably about 80 percent of them against the proposed plant. Additionally, I received nearly 100-150 phone calls from similarly opposed citizens. However, when I was out and about in town, most of the people who came up to speak to me about the project were in favor of it. Most people’s concerns fell into three basic areas. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">F</span><span class="CharOverride-4">irst, they were concerned about the impact the Prestage facility would have on the Environment—specifically, the potential impact on air or water quality, and the impact on the Jordan aquifer from which Mason City draws its water.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">S</span><span class="CharOverride-4">econd, people were worried about cruel treatment of the animals. What would be the conditions in a facility slaughtering 10,000 hogs a day? How would the animals be penned? </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">hird, my constituents wanted to know what impact the influx of new citizens would have on Mason City’s culture, as well as what the cost would be of absorbing a large group of new citizens into our population. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he most common and visceral argument was the one concerning environmental impact. The city had not commissioned an environmental impact study, which, in retrospect, it should have. But city staff did work closely with the Iowa DNR, and DNR’s conclusions were favorable for the city and Prestage. Prestage intended to use new technologies to greatly reduce the smells of the rendering. The company’s plan also called for the plant’s waste to be pretreated and for the hogs to be confined in such a way that ground run-off of their waste would not be a threat to the environment. The company also advanced the argument that the risk for pollution was minimal anyway, as there was no river or stream for the waste it to run into. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">hese were not concerns which I considered as I weighed how I would vote on the proposal. I thought that the smell would not be any different than many other smells common in Iowa. I did not believe the smell would be a daily or even weekly event. Most of the people who argued that the plant would produce a horrible stench brought up towns like St. Joseph, Missouri, or Sioux City, Marshalltown or Storm Lake, Iowa. They argued that if you visited these towns, you would find out how horrible it smells. However, I discovered that this isn’t always the case. When I visited Marshalltown, for instance, there was no vile smell. Councilman Bill Schickel went to St. Joseph and he said that while there was a slight noticeable odor in the industrial area, he wasn’t sure what building it was coming from, and at all events, he wouldn’t say that the smell was vile. Many of the people who were arguing about the smell were mostly talking about Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs. People opposed to these type of facilities often misuse or misunderstand this term. CAFOs can house animals and not ‘confine’ them in tight quarters. Hogs which meet the technical definition for being “free range” can nonetheless be seen as being confined in a CAFO because of their sheer numbers. I felt the CAFO opponents were misrepresenting the argument, and also were attacking farmers. Here is where many of the big worries lie.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">s regards the second concern—about cruel treatment of animals—I would say that this argument had little effect on my decision. Full disclosure: I love my barbeque. I felt I would be a hypocrite if I condemned facilities such as the one being proposed for how it raised its animals. Americans want good meat at a great price, and companies like Prestage try to accommodate our appetites. Also, Iowa law is very clear on these types of operations; if the design and operations meet the requirements of the </span><a href="http://www.iowadnr.gov/Environmental-Protection/Land-Quality/Animal-Feeding-Operations/Confinements/Construction-Requirements/Permitted/Master-Matrix"><span class="Hyperlink CharOverride-4">Master Matrix</span></a><span class="CharOverride-4">, then a local or country government cannot prevent construction of a CAFO in the community. This is battle for the state, not the cities. My focus of concern was always finding an answer to the question: “Should we be incentivizing Prestage to come to our community? And if so, by how much?” </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he third argument was the most involved, and probably the most problematic. How do you have a public discussion about different ethnic groups, hiring practices, housing issues, crime rates, and language barriers, without sounding racist? One of my conversations with Professor Gray concerned this exact topic, and he gave me fair warning. Gray said that housing would be an issue for many different reasons, that crime rates ought to be an absolute concern, and that the language barrier between many workers, the local businesses, and—most importantly—between local police and city staff, should receive serious attention. Gray said the different cultures, their expectations and cultural practices would be a concern, and he urged that any discussion of these issues should occur between the city, its citizens and the company; however, he stressed that it ought to be kept from crossing the line into racism. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">here have been many studies which touch on these issues. One article, citing a study done by Professor Georgeanne Artz from Iowa State University, appeared in 2012 in Choice magazine, an online publication. In this article, entitled, “Immigration and Meatpacking in the Midwest,” Professor Artz looked at hundreds of communities and the impact on hard and soft cost of the type of plant Prestage represented. In our case, these costs would include the ‘hard’ costs of tax rebates to companies, as well as the ‘soft’ costs created by additional demands on social services and city staff by the new residents. While hard costs can be predicted and recorded; soft costs are much more difficult to predict or to even record as they occur. If the Prestage plant opened, it would create a drain on city staff time, as staff worked through the issues that would certainly follow, leaving them with less time to work on other issues that would arise in the normal course of meeting the day-to-day needs of the city.</span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">P</span><span class="CharOverride-4">rofessor Artz argues that there is no clear relationship between crime rates and slaughter facilities. In another study, however—this one from Michigan State University, entitled “Slaughterhouses and Increased Crime Rates”—researchers argued there </span><span class="CharOverride-5">is</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> a correlation. These articles are good examples of the sorts of conflicting ‘evidence’ that were presented in this hostile public debate. Each side found information that supported its stance and its claim to the truth. My job as a</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">city councilman was to sort through all of this data and try to make the best decision based on the information it provided. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">O</span><span class="CharOverride-4">n March 22nd, the Mason City City Council voted unanimously to move ahead with negotiations with Prestage, and thus the formal application to the Iowa Development Economic Authority for state funds began. This was the beginning of the public discourse. At an April 5th meeting, another unanimous vote was taken to proceed with negotiations. However, at this meeting Councilman Kuhn warned City staff and Prestage that if he didn’t see terms more favorable to Mason City, he would vote ‘no’ at the next meeting. At the meeting, I voiced a concern to Prestage that they needed to be partners with the town and they responded positively with a promise for better terms. However, the April 5th vote decided if city staff would continue to negotiate with Prestage and did not finalize conditions of our deal. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">A</span><span class="CharOverride-4">s the days slowly became weeks, and the weeks began to feel like years, it was coming closer and closer to May 2nd—the day scheduled for the final vote, the day when all this research and theory must be weighed and a decision reached. How would the council vote? </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he second official vote took place on April 21st. That night, the vote was five to one with councilman Kuhn the only dissenting voice. This April 21st vote set a public hearing on the final development agreement between the City of Mason City and Prestage Foods. I voted “yes” to set the hearing. By now I was becoming skeptical on whether or not this was a good idea, but felt we needed to continue to move ahead and remain positive. To me, it seemed best to stay upbeat so that if this development passed—whether I liked it or not—Mason City and Prestage would start off their relationship on the best possible footing. Additionally, I felt that changing from a “yes” vote to a “no” vote would be easier than changing from a “no” vote to a “yes” vote—I did not want to lock myself into a position from which I could not return. I also couldn’t see a reason to vote “no” to set a public hearing; Councilman Kuhn told me he didn’t see a path to a “yes,” and therefore voted against the hearing on April 21st. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">hrough a discussion I had with Kuhn the night of the second vote, he made it very clear that he felt the city needed to recover most of the property taxes to be able to pay for the extra demand a plant of this type and scope would place on the local services. I did not talk with him again after the second vote until about an hour before the final meeting. Over the course of the next couple of weeks, I had conversations with some of the other councilmen and staff. It appeared that this resolution was going to pass, but I had great reservations concerning the cost and the impact on the local school district. About one week before the final vote, I received the estimates of costs and revenues that the schools were expecting. </span></p>

They were much worse than I had anticipated. Up until that moment, I had tried to look at this emotionally charged topic through the lens of logic, and what the numbers and scientific studies told me. At this point, I could not just disregard the numbers that concerned me. John Adams famously said, “Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.” To me, this proposed plant, based on the 50 percent tax rebate to Prestage over the next 10 years, was going to cost the city more money than it was going to bring in. </span></p>
			<p class="rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">P</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ublic opinion made up another important part of this equation—one which is really impossible to quantify. Freedom of speech is the cornerstone of our American republic, and the full and fair trial of all ideas in the public arena should be seen as a freedom-of-speech issue. The job of concerned citizens should be to win that public argument by convincing unsure voters of their position. The Prestage debate provides a prime example of the significance of public debate and the reason it’s important to ‘win’ it. In most situations, 20-30 percent of the people will always be in favor of a measure, and another 20-30 percent will oppose. The middle 40-60 percent will determine the winner. During the Prestage debate, the opposition was much more vocal in stating its position and its arguments.The citizens in favor were much less vocal, and were not really even seen in the public eye. I would say approximately 30-35 percent of Mason City’s citizens were passionately against bringing in the factory, and about 10-15 percent were passionately in favor of it. The other 50 percent were indifferent. I considered this, along with the discussions I had with the different professors and the studies I had read, and it seemed to me that, for a plant of this magnitude to work, the people would have to really support it, not be indifferent to it. The local citizenry would have to be willing to very involved in the success of this type of industry. </span></p>

The previous two meetings had both been about that long, and the final vote promised to be the same. Going into the meeting, I knew I was most likely a “no” vote, as was Councilman Kuhn. I had talked with Councilman Schickel before the meeting and was aware of his concerns, but I didn’t know he, too, had changed his vote from “yes” to “no.” After about six hours of citizen comments, it was the turn of the councilmen to speak. Before I talked, Councilman Schickel—who was at home recovering from a medical procedure—was put on speakerphone. In his speech, Shickel said his position was a “no.” At this point, I realized—with two votes surely being “no” and three votes surely being “yes”—that I would be casting the deciding vote. A tie vote would mean the deal would not have a majority and would not go forward.</span></p>

I use the café as my need-to-pee location on the bus route I drive. My CARDINAL bus cycles around the volleyball courts and picnic tables in the grassy median of Freddy Court’s several dozen dorm buildings, and then loops around Iowa State’s central campus. The route is shaped like a figure eight, but riding the wheel doesn’t feel like infinity. Maybe it’s because a cup of coffee fits perfectly in the triangle space made between my radio speaker, tally counter, and dashboard.</p>

The CyBrid hybrid bus’s roof is higher than that of other buses, and that makes clearance under overhanging buildings and trees a hazard. So, CyBrids are used for routes around campus, where there aren’t any awnings to skirt under or boughs draping into the street. While CyBrids guzzle less gas, they’re 3,000 pounds heavier than the other buses in the fleet, and they tear up the roads more with that additional weight. Nonetheless, though the steering is smoother, the brakes apply in three clinches and build up lots of rebound. CyBrid’s batteries charge up as the bus slows down. The brakes create heat from friction while stopping and the bus stores that energy in its battery. After releasing the brake pedal I have to wait for a clunk—the sound of the CyBrid’s engine shifting back into drive—before pressing on the gas, so the bus doesn’t lurch. Students going to and from class are more forgiving of the start and stop of a CyBrid than citizens riding through the city. </span></p>

Then, on July 4th, 1891, Ames’s first engine-driven public transit system rolled along tracks laid on the rutted dirt road from downtown to the campus of Iowa Agricultural College. The Dinkey train—fondly named from a corruption of its small, “donkey” steam engine—pulled three passenger cars. Actually, two locomotives with cattle catchers comprised the Dinkey: one with a flat Victorian roof and ornate lettering and another with a curved roof and simple, block lettering; both read Rapid Transit and #2 along their sides.</span></p>

He would blare the whistle three times to signal that he would depart from downtown in five minutes, and then he would sound two toots as he set the Dinkey chugging out of the depot. Sometimes, the Dinkey linked a flat car behind the passenger cars for mail, luggage, and bicycles. The Dinkey cut through central campus and ended its route next to Morrill Hall at a terminal building still called the Hub.</span></p>

They bought two electric streetcars; one numbered 86 and the other 88, eventually renumbered as 286 and 287. CyRide continued the numbering with mini-buses in 300-series, CyBrids in the 400s, and the other buses continuing to count up.)</span></p>

Daily, two thousand passengers rode to and from the school and downtown. During the transition from steam to electric, the fare had stayed the same and continued to cost one nickel for almost the next twenty years. Eventually, the cost to ride rose to seven cents to compete with the unregulated Hutchinson Bus Line, but in 1929 the trolley ceased rolling. In 1930, the tracks were removed.</span></p>

In the spirit of the “National Strategy,” I designed and led a community engagement project which immersed locally-minded plant-enthusiasts from my Ohio community in wildflower prairie improvement. From an environmental perspective, my focus was on the change in local flora before and after the project, and the potential outcomes that shift could have on pollinator populations. From a community perspective, I focused on the importance of involving community members in the process of improving biodiversity, and increasing participants’ understanding of the conservation issues involved. Through this project I have also learned a great deal about the importance of “native-scaping,” or using native plant species to support native wildlife, through researching the species present in the wildflower blend made available to the project. Throughout the development, hurdles, and continuing follow-up of this community project I have grown as both a student and as a conservationist.</span></p>

However, traveling cross-country, as my father’s work took him to many different states, allowed me to grow my interest in the grassy plains and colorful hillocks of the areas west of the Mississippi. After moving to Columbus, Ohio, for college, and undertaking a Master’s degree focused on wildlife conservation, I gathered life experience and a deeper understanding of my environment and its shifting challenges. North American prairie landscapes became of particular interest to me when I discovered that near my home outside of Columbus are several restored prairies in Columbus Metro Parks—natural playgrounds where families can explore nature with the benefit of clear trails and maps. </span></p>

How many plants or plant species are required to support a single pollinator, a variety of which were ever-present in the prairie, but not near my home? Can a person, a team, or a community create long-term change for prairies and their inhabitants? Does it really take—as Emily Dickinson suggests—just one clover and a bee?</span></p>

By influencing the diversity of flora in a region through farming, clear-cutting, and other “improvement” practices, humans have inadvertently affected the suitability of the environment for pollinators and other animals (Haaland &amp; Gyllin, 2011). </span></p>

The conservation work at Battelle-Darby Creek has consisted of the restoration of over one thousand acres of wet and tall-grass prairie in the Darby Creek region through controlled burns and seeding practices (Metro Parks, 2012, 2013). Restoration of the Darby Plains Prairie, which existed in the region prior to the American westward expansion, is hoped to encourage improvement in regional biodiversity.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he pollinator population in North America has suffered declines due to a variety of factors, including habitat loss and disease (vanEnglesdorp et al., 2008). For example, migratory pollinators such as the Monarch Butterfly (</span><span class="CharOverride-5">Danaus plexippus</span><span class="CharOverride-4">) and Ruby-Throated Hummingbird (</span><span class="CharOverride-5">Archilochus colubris</span><span class="CharOverride-4">) have been greatly affected by the loss of prairie landscape, normally rich with a variety of wildflowers and grasses. The cyclical way in which pollinators and plants interact has affected plant-life as well; with fewer pollinators there is a decrease in the successful seeding of wild plants. The removal of any player in the prairie cycle will cause a “Butterfly Effect,” creating detrimental outcomes for all species in the long term. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">O</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ne third of the food consumed on Earth is produced through pollination; in the U.S. alone, this amounts to an estimated $15 billion in agricultural products (Calderone, 2012; Pollinator Health Task Force, 2015). The United States of America has issued its “National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honeybees and Other Pollinators” in an effort to combat the lasting effects of habitat loss, pestilence, and disease. With approximately 75 percent of all plant species reliant on pollinators for reproduction, and with one-third of the food humans eat being dependent on those plant species, the decline of pollinator populations is tied directly to the health of the human race (Ellsworth, 2014; Dirzo et al., 2014). </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">W</span><span class="CharOverride-4">hile the negative impacts caused by urban sprawl are much publicized, there are practices which we can undertake to significantly improve our world. Humans can improve the pollination cycle through seeding of natural meadows and prairies, or through developing “Native-scaped” home gardens—the transformation of garden and yard space into natural habitats for local wildlife by planting more native plants and reducing non-native species (Sempill-Watts, 2014). These practices encourage migratory stopovers by birds, butterflies, and other wildlife, which similarly add attraction and value to the property. Unfortunately, the seed mix donated to this project was a blend including many non-native plant species. It was through learning more about the species in the mix that I came to better understand the importance of regionally appropriate plants being used in seed blends and natural control methods for preventing non-native plant proliferation. </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="CharOverride-21">What do we mean by “biodiversity?”</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">B</span><span class="CharOverride-4">iologist E.O. Wilson said: “Biodiversity is the totality of all inherited variation in the life forms of Earth, of which we are one species. We study and save it to our great benefit. We ignore and degrade it to our great peril.” </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">B</span><span class="CharOverride-4">iodiversity is the variety of life present within a given ecosystem. Ecosystem diversity is the supportive structure for a habitat—the variety of biological organisms in an area and their interconnected, interdependent roles in the environment (Primack, 2010). Maintaining ecosystem variety through management practices is a balancing act, requiring identification of keystone species, understanding how they help maintain the health</span><span class="CharOverride-4"> </span><span class="CharOverride-4">of other species in their environment, and balancing conservation focus and potential impacts of biodiversity shift. As one species increases another may decrease due to competition for resources—creating balance can be difficult, as outcomes are not always predictable.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">E</span><span class="CharOverride-4">verything—all life and all conditions—within an ecosystem ties together in a complicated web. To approach a biodiversity improvement project, when you perform a survey of a possible area of conservation effort, you must review not only the major players, but also the support system. For instance, if you’re working on a monarch butterfly project, you have to look for the presence and variety of milkweed plants in the area. Are there enough to support a population? Are the preferred varieties present in abundance? Is the soil healthy enough to support a variety of milkweed plants? If your aim is to promote biodiversity, then each aspect of the habitat will affect the ultimate outcome. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-4">So why is biodiversity important? Contrary to Emily Dickinson’s lovely lines, above, I believe that making a prairie takes more than “one clover and one bee,” What would happen, for instance, if the species of clover mentioned in the poem were to fall victim to a specialized fungal infection, or if especially harsh weather conditions struck, and the clover died off? In such a situation, there must be a habitat support system in place to ensure the survival of that bee and its brethren. We depend on pollinators to help us manage crops and ensure bountiful harvests, that means that losing a pollinator species within an agricultural region will, eventually, haunt the human race. There is a growing movement within the agricultural industry to mitigate the potentially negative effects of “monocrops,” or single species plantings, by surrounding farm fields with a variety of seeded wildflowers to support pollinator populations. In some states, transportation departments are also seeding wildflowers along the grassy edges of highways and roadsides to encourage pollinator habitat.</span></p>

This property, owned by my husband’s family, is close to our hearts: we lived there as caretakers after completing our undergraduate degrees. There are several habitat types on the property, including tall-grass prairie, a pine and hardwood forest, and a five-acre lake. </span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he original purpose of my study was to learn about the impact of flower biodiversity on animal biodiversity, and to better understand the role of community engagement projects in biodiversity. The importance of native species was not something I was very focused on until I began to dive deeper into this project. A gardening firm donated a large bag of wildflower seed mix to our project. Not all seeds in the mix (Figure 1) are native Ohio species, but for the purpose of creating a diverse landscape and due to the cost limitations of this project, I judged that including some non-natives would help us to reach our ultimate goal. The location is also fairly contained, being surrounded on all sides by forest and in a small valley, which should help to prevent wind-carried seed spread. On a positive note, the seed manufacturer has since changed their recipe to remove potentially invasive varieties. I will also be performing surveys of the field to determine which plant species have been successful over time. </span></p>

My initial survey of the area showed that it is covered primarily in tall grasses with a few naturally occurring wildflowers—nine identified species. The acreage was regularly managed by mowing at the end of the growing season around mid-October. Continuing this management system will help enable this field to become a long-lasting, healthy pollinator habitat with high wildflower species diversity (Jones &amp; Hayes, 1998). </span></p>

With approximately 450,000 seeds per pound, participants sowed around 18 million seeds during this one event.

Sowing this volume and diversity of wildflower species has the potential to provide food and shelter for many pollinator species, and increase the pollinator biodiversity for the region, including preferential pollinator populations (Fründ, Linsenmair, and Blüthgen, 2010), and an increase by this amount may have an exponential effect in the long term. Future surveys will tell me which species in the blend were successful, which were not, and which may need removed if some of the non-natives show too much success. </span></p>

Previous research with a similar Lupine species, Lupinus perennus, indicates that higher densities of Lupine are more impactful on pollinator populations than a larger coverage area at lower densities (Bernhardt, Mitchell, and Michaels, 2008), which is one reason that the selected three acre area was chosen for this project.</span></p>

In the words of Naomi Klein, this changes everything. How can an author who loves nature avoid this topic with a clear conscience? And yet, how can she hope to face this juggernaut undaunted? My high school English teacher, Michael Niflis, whose opinion I greatly respected, could not imagine how any intelligent person could look at the world around us without considering depression a rational perspective – and yet, if we choose to believe we cannot change the world, we acquiesce to our own impotence, which is a moral failure. Al Gore’s books about climate change dominate through sheer force of data, but nobody will ever read them for enjoyment. His Climate Leadership Trainings, which seek to empower anyone and everyone to become a peer educator, involve many terrifying film clips of floods and hurricanes, as well as graphs and tables, but he explicitly acknowledges the need to avoid overwhelming people with either data or fear. Most of all, he argues, we must convey a message of hope, if we are to convince anyone to take action. </p>

Mutel gave us a sneak preview of her book in the Fall 2015 edition of this publication. She explores change on an intimate scale, on her own property, in a Midwestern woodland, openly acknowledging the personal grief that any lover of nature must feel upon learning about the dire state of the earth. If E. O. Wilson is right, and biophilia, the love of the living world, is truly a fundamental human trait, then there must be many of us who share Mutel’s passionate attachment to nature – and not just nature in general, but the familiar and particular creatures of the landscapes that have shaped us, where we joyously greet the rugged bark and lobed leaves of a bur oak like an old and trusted friend. Of her sons’ reminiscences about their outdoor childhood, she writes, “ . . . their stories tell me that this house, this plot of land remain their planet’s center, a stable refuge, a dreamscape to which our sons mentally return when times get rough. Our home and the surrounding woods have nurtured them, protecting and providing stability for their spirits even after their bodies left to roam elsewhere.” Mutel ties the childhood she has provided for her children to the idyllic childhood she took for granted, rambling her Madison neighborhood looking for caterpillars, and working in the garden with her beloved mother. The plangent notes of a time and place that are irretrievably lost resonate with her fear that we now face a larger passing away, not of a personal neighborhood or family member, but of the comfortable and reliable rhythms of seasons worldwide on which not only nature, but civilization depends. </span></p>

Indeed, a polar vortex that sweeps down from the Canadian shield in the dark of midwinter can make an immediate increase in temperature seem attractive. In a climate where everyone has air-conditioned houses because it is already warm and humid in the summer, even a rise in summer temperatures seems unlikely to increase human suffering significantly at first glance. Furthermore, the imminent sea rise that is already worsening the effects of hurricanes and inundating coastal Florida frightens no one in Iowa on a personal level, and there are sound reasons why this is so. Mutel would have to drive more than 900 miles from Iowa City to reach the nearest Florida beach. But the beauty of Mutel’s book lies in the way it tenderly describes the intimate violence that climate change wreaks on the homey little wild places that remain in the heartland of Iowa. The fencerows and margins that are left unplowed by the behemoths that harvest our crops, as well as small scattered woods and fragments of restored prairie, provide safe harbor for the dwindling remnants of the vast wildlife populations that once roamed Iowa’s ocean of tall grass and abundant rivers and wetlands. Mutel lovingly documents the migrations of birds, the phenology of spring ephemerals, and all the drama of the changes in weather that we expect to accompany each season in the same way that we expect our parents to be the way they are: because they have always been so, within our experience. She informs those of us who may have felt safe by virtue of geography that we are in fact threatened, just like everyone else on the planet, and she does this by bearing witness to all the small lives that are harmed right now by the changes that are taking place too swiftly for adaptation to be successful. At the same time, she demonstrates that even those who may not give a fig for nature should be very afraid at the prospect of what climate change will do to agriculture, a primary economic driver in a state where more than 99 percent of the original prairie has been plowed under to raise crops and livestock. Gullywashers that strip fields of priceless topsoil alternate with flash droughts that sear plants with abrupt heat. The nurturing climate where human agriculture evolved, which has made our croplands so successful and obviated the need to irrigate, may become a thing of the past unless we take immediate action. </span></p>

Throughout her life, nature has been not only an object of study, but a touchstone and a healer. Her mother’s midlife death from cancer at the beginning of her own first year of college plunged her into a natural depression, from which she emerged under the healing influence of an arboretum. Her courtship took place in the Colorado Rockies, with a partner whose love of nature was equaled only by her own. When she underwent her own first bout with cancer, she remembers the moment when she overcame her fear that her fate would mirror that of her mother. She was watching blackbirds and geese flying overhead. Like Basho, she finds in the natural world a resonance with the rhythms and patterns of her own life, and a powerful source of strength in even its most fragile denizens. </span></p>

Some arguments are hard to counter. Religious historian Prasenjit Duara argues that, whereas humans used to find transcendence only in religion, or political doctrines such as Marxism, perhaps the time has come when we need to seek transcendence in sustainability. On our own soil, in the prairie, Cordelia Mutel has produced a book that calls for just such transcendence. Other countries, such as Germany, have acknowledged what is required and stepped up to the task, as have many cities, and some states, here in the U.S. Mutel ends on a note of hope, and her lovely book is solid evidence that, despite dark threats to end funding for climate change study, we still have reason to be hopeful for our future, as long as such writers persist. Perhaps her affectionate portrait of the dear and familiar place where we all live can spur more of us to spirited resistance against the forces that would destroy it. As I write this, on the winter solstice, I hope we will see the return of the light.</span> </p>

Grinnell’s Center for Prairie Studies—which started in 1999, during her time as a student at Grinnell—has had a great impact on her work. Melis says the art she has produced since her undergraduate days has been influenced by what she learned about prairie art and ecology from professors including Jon Andelson, Mark Baechtel, Jackie Brown, Tony Crowley (former Grinnell Art Professor), and her fellow-students in Grinnell’s Environmental Action Group. Melis has lived in three prairie states since Iowa—Wisconsin, Kansas, and Minnesota—and says that in each one, she has found inspiration from the land and people around her for her artists’ books, prints and installations. </span></p>

She strives with her work to record, re-imagine, re-image and re-print the vitality, diversity and importance of the Midwest’s native plants, ecosystems, and peoples. Her work also celebrates writers from the nineteenth-century and today who have observed closely the complexities of Midwestern and rural life. Currently, Melis is creating images about bird, plant, and food metaphors used by and about women and children.</span></p>

Conservationists work tirelessly to preserve pieces of these ancient flyways to help the cranes continue their age-old migration patterns. The cranes rely on one another to complete each journey safely, but unknowingly they also now rely on their human advocates.</span></p>

Their partnership yielded “sound sculptures” which they created at Grinnell College during the 2014-2015 academic year from found organic materials. The artists said that their sculptures are inspired by the relationship between sound and touch, “one that is par</span><span class="CharOverride-38">ticularly powerful in the prairie.”</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">“</span><span class="CharOverride-4">One’s sense of touch is particularly important in the prairie,” Aresty said. “Without the ability to reach out and touch, it is all too easy to overlook the tremendous variety of grasses, flowers, and trees which make up the prairie. And yet, prairie can be hard to come by these days. Branches, a collaboration of artists Abby Aresty and Eden Marek, are what they refer to as sound sculptures: interactive works that allow participants to engage with the complex textures of the prairie from a distance. Combining handmade paper and custom electronics, the artists transform ordinary branches into art objects which bridge sound, vibration, and touch to create a truly immersive experience.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">E</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ach sculpture consists principally of a branch, chosen for both its visual aesthetic and acoustic potential, hand-made abaca fiber paper, and a surface transducer that converts an electrical signal to the vibrations made audible by the branches. Audio cables, small mono amplifiers, and a sound source, such as an iPod, are also used. The soft, subtle, pattern of creaks and groans that emanates from the sculptures evokes the sounds you might hear if you held a stethoscope to a tree trunk on a windy day.</span></p>

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">S</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ince June 15, 1983, I’ve had the good fortune to serve as the Executive Director of the Amana Heritage Society, a local non-profit historical society in Amana, Iowa. I was born and raised in Middle Amana and live in the house of my childhood. Having done my graduate work in history at the University of Iowa I am doubly fortunate to be a historian in and of my own home town.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he Amana Heritage Society was formed in 1968 with a mission to collect, preserve and interpret the Amana Colonies&apos; cultural heritage. Amana has a rich German ethnic heritage and was founded on strong religious conviction, but its communal organization—and the landscape, villages, buildings, material culture and cultural traditions which communalism fostered—is what put it on the map, or at least on the National Register of Historic Places, a status it received in 1965 as one of the largest National Historic Landmarks in the United States. My good fortune again: we have a great story to tell, relevant to today, about the power of religious faith and cooperative labor, the place of individuals and families in a community, and sustainability to name just a few themes.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he Amana Heritage Museum in the village of Amana began with the acquisition of a historical communal-era residence, the Noe House, which was converted into a museum with exhibits on its two floors which trace the history of the community from Europe to Amana. The property included the adjacent washhouse/woodshed, virtually unchanged since the early 20th century, which is also open to museum visitors. In 1975 we added the neighboring village schoolhouse to the museum complex. Today the second floor of the schoolhouse houses the museum offices, curatorial workspace, and the library and archives. The main floor has the visitor reception area, the museum bookstore, and a 60-seat auditorium in which we show a 20-minute orientation video to museum visitors.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he Amana Heritage Society also owns or leases other historical properties in the Amana Colonies. Two have become central points of our interpretation: the Communal Kitchen in Middle Amana (leased from a private individual) and the Homestead Church (acquired from the Amana Church Society). As the places where people ate together and worshipped together, these buildings are ideal settings for visitors to learn about life in communal Amana and the religious beliefs and traditions of the Amana people. These spaces give visitors a clear sense of how life was different in communal Amana. The Heritage Society owns three additional historical buildings: the Homestead Store, the Homestead Blacksmith Shop, and the Middle Amana Cooper Shop. We also rent the 1858 High Amana General Store which we use as a museum store.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">O</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ne of the current points of emphasis in the museum profession is to encourage museums to be closer to the communities in which they are located and responsive to their needs. For example, the theme of this year’s Iowa Museum Association conference is “Celebrating Community.” For the Amana Heritage Society, that hasn’t been much of a concern. The society has always been deeply grounded in the Amana community. The museum was founded by an ad hoc group of local residents, and community volunteers have continued to play a key role in the development and growth of the organization. The organization is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of nine volunteer members from the community. The museum’s collections of artifacts, documents and photographs have all been built on donations from community members. In the beginning community residents and descendants donated items to the museum from their woodsheds and attics—artifacts, examples of Amana’s material culture. We are still nearly overwhelmed with donations from individuals, but now we are receiving items from peoples’ closets and file cabinets, mostly manuscripts and photographs. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he Amana Heritage Society takes an active role in the life of the Amana community. It is “at the table” for discussion of community issues and concerns, participates in local events and programs, and its resources are used by the community to an extent most museums would envy. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">F</span><span class="CharOverride-4">urther, the Heritage Society is an important component in the Amana Colonies’ sense of community identity. When the Heritage Society was founded many Amana residents and descendants were still somewhat embarrassed by their communal heritage, their German language, and their different religious traditions. In its early days the Heritage Society helped local residents realize that their heritage was something to be proud of and preserve; that their story was important to share. An oral history project undertaken in 1982 to commemorate the 50th year anniversary of the end of the communal system gave the community an opportunity to celebrate its heritage and culture. And it has continued to embrace those.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he Heritage Society also helps to provide a wider context for our local history, demonstrating that we are not alone. Through its affiliation with organizations such as the Communal Studies Association and Silos and Smokestacks National Heritage Area, the Heritage Society helps show community members that our story is indeed part of larger historical patterns and themes. Through our association with the Communal Studies Association, we have learned that our community’s religious and communal heritage is not unique, but rather has much in common with other religious and communal groups in the United States. The agricultural interpretive themes articulated by Silos and Smokestacks help us contrast Amana’s villages and landscape with Midwestern family farms, as well as provide a general framework for understanding Amana’s agricultural development.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">M</span><span class="CharOverride-4">y 33-some years have included several community milestones. In 2005 we observed Amana’s sesquicentennial. While many communities use an anniversary like this to rediscover or reconnect with their history, in Amana the event was simply a good reason for a celebration. We are a community that is closely in touch with our history—on a daily basis—thanks in part to the fact that we host so many tourist visitors who are interested in our story. The year 2009 also saw a milestone, though not many people noted it: that year marked the point when our post-communal history exceeded the duration of the communal era in Amana. Our museum exhibits have been reworked to bring our story up to the present, and our guides will attest that visitors to Amana are just as likely to     be interested in Amana’s life after communalism and Amana today, as they are in our communal past. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I</span><span class="CharOverride-4">n 2014 the Amana Church observed the 300th anniversary of its founding. We created a special exhibit at the museum in conjunction with the Church programs. The exhibit traced the history of the church through the history of its publications, and it gave us a way to focus on the European roots of our community’s history. The printing heritage is probably the aspect of Amana history that interests me most and I feel especially fortunate to have been around for this tri-centennial observance. From my first days at the museum we have worked to build the collections of books and manuscripts generated by the church and community. Today we can say we have in our collection every known publication of the community with the notable exception of the second edition of the church hymnal printed in 1729.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">O</span><span class="CharOverride-4">ur involvement with the community has been a constant over the years. Community support is as strong as ever. Another source of support, mostly financial in this case, has not been so dependable, though. Unlike that of most small local historical societies, our operating budget relies on a high percentage of earned revenue. “Earned revenue” is the museum world’s term for income from admissions and store sales, and for us that translates directly to tourism and the number of museum admissions paid by tourist visitors. I long ago stopped trying to explain—much less predict—tourism’s ebb and flow. It is what it is, as the saying goes, but over the past three decades, admission numbers have generally trended down. The good news is that the trend has recently reversed: the last three years have shown significant increases in visitors and hence revenue. We live with the unpredictability of tourism and earned revenue.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">D</span><span class="CharOverride-4">espite the vagaries of tourist numbers there is a continuing interest in Amana’s story. Even with more competition from other historical sites, the higher cost of travel, and a general decline in museum attendance nationwide, people still come to Amana and to the museum. In 2015 over 12,000 people visited the museum, representing all 50 states and 32 countries. Since we started keeping a list in 1985, the museum has hosted visitors from 116 countries. And although there might be fewer visitors overall, I think those who do come are better informed and coming for more of the right reasons compared to visitors 30 years ago. The internet has made a huge difference in preparing the potential visitor to Amana, both in what Amana has to offer and its history. For example, 30 years ago we spent a lot of time and energy explaining to visitors that Amana was not Amish. It was a major point in our visitor orientation and interaction. The Amana/Amish confusion still shows up occasionally, but it is increasingly rare. For the most part, people choose to come to Amana today knowing what it’s about. Furthermore, while some visitors today might be coming to Amana for the dining, shopping or festivals, many more than in the past want a little history with their entertainment. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">P</span><span class="CharOverride-4">eople come to the Amana Colonies because of the history, culture, and ambience. We see many different interests. Some people are curious about how the communal system worked, why it ended, or how people adapted to the new way of life. Some focus on the religious roots, or the state of the religion today. I think the specific interests all stem from that fact that Amana, past and present, represents an alternative to ordinary American life and culture. Amana’s communal heritage presents an alternative social and economic American experience. The landscape, village lay-out, and architecture of Amana had and still has a different look than other American towns. The friendliness of residents, the sense of community and Gemuetlichkeit give Amana a different feel than most other places. Visitors seem to appreciate all of those things.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">S</span><span class="CharOverride-4">o what has changed? The obvious I suppose: the passing of time means essentially the passing of generations and the demographic and cultural change that goes with it. For the Amana Heritage Society that has meant several things. First, it means that we have had to try to reach out to a new audience: more recent residents and business owners who might or might not have any Amana lineage. But while they might not have a family link, we have found there is a more concrete one, or perhaps I should say brick, stone, and wood. The Amana landscape and built environment is still a very strong and direct link with our past. The history of the building and the people and families who lived or worked there provides an excellent opportunity to connect with a new property owner and community member. Another new audience that was a challenge to reach—but is easier now with websites and social media—is those people who are descendants of Amana but living far away, who nevertheless have a sense of belonging. Amana it seems still provides a “grounding” or foundation for many who might have lived here only in their youth or perhaps even not at all.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he passing of generations has also changed the way we do things at the museum. Thirty-three years ago we didn’t have to worry about our “interpretive plan.” Our museum guides were mostly Amana residents who had lived in the communal era. We simply let them talk to visitors and tell their stories. Museum patrons learned what life was like in the communal system from people who had actually lived it. I don’t think you can do better than that. Now I find myself talking about my parents or my grandparents—retelling their stories. Still today we have knowledgeable museum docents/guides who talk with, interact with, museum visitors. There is a recurring emphasis in museum philosophy to provide the visitor with an interactive experience. Twenty-five years ago that might have meant pushing a button or opening a box. Today it’s a touch screen. I strongly believe that the best interactive experience a museum visitor can have is interacting with another person—a museum guide. We know we reached people when they ask questions, express opinions, and/or share their personal experiences. I personally find it very rewarding when, while I talk about life in Amana, audience members start talking about their experiences. I remember one tour many years ago of about 15 people that included one Japanese-American woman. After I had spoken about daily life and family life in communal Amana, she remarked how much that reminded her of how her grandmother had described life back home. We made a connection.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">hirty-three years ago our primary resource for Amana history was the generation that had experienced communal living. Our primary resource was people and our primary research tool was the telephone. When we had a question, we would phone someone we thought would know: “How did you….?” “Where was the….?” “Who was in charge of…?” Still today, our main resources—the ones used most often—are our collections of oral histories and historical photographs, both of which give history a personal face, a connection with people. For all the concern with utilizing technology in museums, ultimately it is the stories of people of the past that resonate with people today.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">he same generation that gave us information, also provided us with another resource: knowledge of the German language and the old German script. One of our biggest challenges at the museum, and as a community, is to translate the huge body of German-language heritage into English. And one of our biggest frustrations is that we have so much material in German that is not utilized because of the language and script barriers. Over the years we have relied a lot on community members, on local Amana folks, to transcribe and translate, but increasingly we need to look elsewhere. </span></p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-5"><span class="CharOverride-4">The short-eared owl is a medium-sized birth that ranges 13 to 17 inches from tip of bill to tail tip. It has black-rimmed yellow eyes, a pale facial disk, and short ear tufts which are not always visible. Both sexes are similar in appearance with the female being physically larger. The short-eared owl hunts both day and night –mainly during dawn and dusk in the winter. When hunting it flies low over fields, with buoyant, floppy wingbeats, looking rather like a giant moth. Like all owls, their flight is silent due to special feather adaptations. It locates prey mostly by sound but also by sight. Diet while mostly rodents can include birds, reptiles, fish, rabbits, muskrats, large insects, and rarely bats. Short-eared owls inhabit open terrain including grasslands, marsh, dunes, and tundra that support high numbers of small rodents. Large complexes of grasslands and wetlands are ideal.

			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="_idGenDropcap-1">T</span><span class="CharOverride-4">hough Ken Saunders numbers hiking and nature study among his primary interests, nature photography is his passion. Photography, in his mind, dovetails with all his other interests.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">S</span><span class="CharOverride-4">aunders got his first camera, a Kodak 104 Instamatic, when he was around seven years old. This camera used a 126 film cartridge and featured a connector for the new (at the time) flashcube. The 104 retailed for $15.95 when launched in 1963. Kodak sold 60 million of the various models of “Instamatic” cameras in the 1960s and 1970s. Back then, Saunders enjoyed taking snapshots of family, friends, and travel destinations during those early days.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">F</span><span class="CharOverride-4">inally in 1985, he purchased his first (and only) 35mm film SLR (single lens reflex) camera—a Pentax Super Program, plus several Pentax lens. Saunders started focusing on nature (flora and fauna), scenery, and some macro photography consisting mostly of flora. He did majority of his photography during this time on trips to various national parks. Initially Saunders used print film, but transitioned later to slide film.</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">S</span><span class="CharOverride-4">aunders began his digital experience in 2003 with a Nikon Coolpix 5700, a high end digital camera that was not a SLR. The fixed lens in the body gave him the equivalent of a 35-280mm zoom. Saunders also purchased a Nikon adaptor, a Nikon 28mm wide angle converter, and a Nikon 1.5x telephoto converter. He continued to focus on nature photography, including macro photography. With the adapter and the 1.5x teleconverter installed, the equivalent focal length became 52.5-420mm. This improved his ability to capture wildlife and, as he puts it, he “quickly became addicted to the longer focal length!”</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">I</span><span class="CharOverride-4">n 2006 Saunders purchased his first DSLR (digital single lens reflex)—a Nikon D200 and several Nikkor (Nikon) lens. He claims that the learning curve changed dramatically for him as he made use of his newest digital equipment technology, which had the added benefit of eliminating the purchase and loading of film. With this new suite of equipment, Saunders was willling to branch out, trying multipe settings and taking lots of shots. Since 2006, he has upgraded camera bodies several times, added a couple of lens, and obtained a set of teleconverters. As he puts it, “There is no going back!”</span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">W</span><span class="CharOverride-4">hile Saunders has spent considerable time over the years photographing nature in northwest Wyoming, the vast majority of his photography is captured in Iowa, and usually not too far from Grinnell. All the photos for this feature were captured within a 28-mile radius (42-miles maximum driving distance) of Grinnell. </span></p>
			<p class="Letter-V_rootstalk_Lead-Pages_Body-Paragraph"><span class="Letter-V_Drop-Cap CharOverride-4">S</span><span class="CharOverride-4">aunders hopes that his photography will further the cause of environmental education, perhaps stimulating those who are not familiar with the gifts of nature, or further stimulating those who already are. Saunders feels that if one becomes more intimate with nature, one is likely to realize these gifts, perhaps becoming passionate about them, and certainly becoming interested in not losing them. He feels his photographycan bring attention to that in the natural world which is threatened, saying: “It would be difficult to feel loss if one is not aware of what they are losing.”</span></p>

Their wingspans range from one and one-half to two and three-quarters inches, and they almost always perch with their wings closed. Clouded sulfurs have multiple (three to four) broods and fly from early spring to late fall. The clouded sulfur is one of the latest flying butterflies that does not hibernate overwinter as an adult. Their flight is slightly erratic and direct. Adults drink nectar from many different flowers and they obtain moisture from water, mud, and animal dung. Larval foodplants include black locust, white clover, alfalfa, and other legumes. Clouded sulfurs inhabit open areas especially hayfields, prairies, and lawns and along roadsides near these habitats. </span></p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph ParaOverride-5"><span class="CharOverride-4">The bald eagle has been the national emblem of the United States since 1782 and a spiritual symbol for Native Americans far longer than that. A large, powerful bird of prey, it has a wingspan of seven to eight feet. Bald eagles spend their first four years exploring vast territories, and can fly hundreds of miles per day. They obtain their adult plumage at age five, which is also when they start breeding. They are long-lived, with a record of 38 years achieved in the wild. They build some of the largest bird nests—typically five to six feet across and two to three feet. tall. Nests can take up to three months to build, may be reused (and added to) year after year, and can weigh over a ton. Though often solitary, bald eagles congregate by scores or even hundreds at communal roosts and feeding sites, particularly in winter. Bald eagles’ diet consists mainly of fish and carrion but they will also hunt birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and invertebrates. They occasionally hunt cooperatively, with one individual flushing prey toward another. (Description adapted courtesy of Ken Saunders).</span></p>
